# Challenge 2: Refactoring VBA Code to Improve Performance Speed

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to improve the performance speed of the VBA code. This code was created to calculate the volume and return for 12 different stocks, specifically including the Daqo (DQ ticker) that Steve's parents are investing in. Steve needs a program that can calculate the volume and return stocks at a faster speed than the current program because he wants to analyze more stocks than just the 12 that he is currently looking at. In this challenge, we have been given the code to run the program. Our job is to refactor code sections into the script to improve performance speed.
