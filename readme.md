# Challenge 2: Refactoring VBA Code to Improve Performance Speed

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to improve the performance speed of the VBA code. This code was created to calculate the volume and return for 12 different stocks, specifically including the Daqo (DQ ticker) that Steve's parents are investing in. Steve needs a program that can calculate the volume and return stocks at a faster speed than the current program because he wants to analyze more stocks than just the 12 that he is currently looking at. In this challenge, we have been given the code to run the program. Our job is to refactor code sections into the script to improve performance speed.

## Results

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages
Refactoring code takes time, resource, and money. However, altering the script can result in product imporovement and be well worth the energy. In this scenario, making alterations to the VBA script resulted in making the program run much faster. The 2017 run time improved from 1.01 seconds to .23 seconds. The 2018 run time improved from 1.03 seconds to .24 seconds. In a real life scenario, I would make sure to work with a programmer who has a lot of experience with refactoring code, to minimize resource spent and to maximize profit.
